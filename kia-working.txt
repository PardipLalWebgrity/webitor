* User can upload own svg
- ???

* border-radious separately
- Just Like Figma

* Text layer must be background free, & default is lorem ipsum text.
* layer duplicate not work on svg
* hover effect show, svg is selected but when user select page going to select because of if shape has no fill, shape select by only stroke, which is very hard for user.
* When duplicate text node, in sidebar, it show P instead of TEXT.
* Wht fill update stroke instead of stroke for color of star.
* When layer add, it append at the end but when page load it show 1st. Or whole vice-versa.












* New Structure Of Canvas Component
- events
-- click.js
-- input.js
- utils
-- methods.js
-- props.js
- tools
-- move.js
-- zoom.js
-- html-section.js
-- html-text.js
- workspace
-- layer.js
-- page.js
-- canvas.js
== WBTR.canvas.methods, WBTR.canvas.props, WBTR.canvas.tools.zoom.abc(), WBTR.canvas.workspace.layer.abc()

* Duplicate Page 
- already coded

* Layer select, show it dimension
- use ::before 

* all css style in css property & attribute in attr of layer object in layers objectStore store. because layer has if 10 property and loop on each can lag on page load.
- HTML = attr, css
- SVG = attr, css, sattr, scss


* A only function which handle to set css to active layers of canvas - active mean user select by click or by draging


* Select multiple layers
- when user drag selection, dont hide div, just remove bg color as transparent, when user move, internally move selection div, in selection div a function call, to move all selected layers


* 1st time when page load, ui component after load and frequently used component. Exceprt these components, in main component class - a list for stable component in array. Add a method in main component is disconnectedCallback, when component remove, this method clean memory. 

* Remove sleft & stop, which use for left & top. stay with official - left & top.

* Canvas's _drawCanvasHTMLAndCSS - HTML Tag, SVG Tag, Page, 

* add a function (selectElement) to main component to select element from shadow root ro replace "shadowRoot.querySelector"

* Add radio(s) as icon for devices at canvas top-center - Desktop, Mobile, Tab. Default is desktop. based on device, css added to later object

* Maintain z-index based on page, not whole canvas.

* In left sidebar, show layers in page wise, just like figma

* use css variable only for that which need to change like when mode change feom light to dark.

** below concept is for future. As much as possible we create css props category as minimum requirement of design. User use this concept to increase application concept
* user can register own properties
- Types px, color, dropdown, int
Note :- Assume, in future, there are a css property {childrens: 3;}. Even if parent has many children, but show only 3 childrens. Than user register own property as int just like {name: children, value: int, category: css-category-name}. In more-settings component dropdown. User has option to where to show this property in dropdown. On register css property time, user can also register css-property-category.

* May or Not, In more-settings popup, right side, a search icon, user click , a search input appear. User search border, all border related properties show like border-color, border-width, border-height

* In assets tab, add these options...
- CSS Extensions = open a big popup to add custom css property based on previous Types
- Tag Styles = when user click, show all tags in place of canvas, mean every tag with some contents. So, user can understand, when it use in a design, how it appear just like DIVI Post Content Template
- Components = currently unknown
- UI Library = a right arrow in option, when user click. List of ui library show like Bootstrap, Tailwind, jQuery

_____________

* Assets
  ** Theme
	   		*** Element Styles = When user click on menu-item. Hide canvas & show Elements Web component where all html tags show with contents where user can understatnd - how it look when those elements use.
		 		*** Variables = When user click on menu-item. a popup show which maintain variables like - new create, add to element, modify variable. Mean, when user want set variable to element, this popup show, small view.  Design like figma similar.
